surfcut-python is an **incomplete** port of `the SurfCut macro for ImageJ/FIJI <https://github.com/sverger/SurfCut>`_

If you would like to use SurfCut, we recommend the original macro. However, if you want to use this Python version, please do get in touch.

Headless Mode
=============

If you are a Python user, this package is available on pip:

::

    pip install surfcut

To run from the command line:

::

    surfcut <image name>.tif

This version implements Surfcut exactly as in the original paper.

A version including morphological operations (erode and dilate) is available for surfaces which are very curved, but is much slower than the original approach.

::

    surfcut <image name>.tif -m

.. image:: resources/morph.gif

For more options:

::

    surfcut --help
